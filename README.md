Just got out of watching Riff Raff... and wow, I'm in that weird zone where you're not even sure if you liked it or hated it, but you definitely felt something—and isn't that the point of movies? Or life? I dunno. Might be the tiredness talking. Or maybe those nachos that sat a bit too long under the heat lamp. 

Anyway, Riff Raff. Blew in like a raw, chaotic whirlwind—like watching a can of paint spill on a dirty sidewalk in slow motion. It's all these random colors you didn't expect and suddenly you're an art critic, or maybe just questioning your life choices. The cast, man. They’re not actors, they’re just people who accidentally wandered in front of a camera and decided to live their messy lives there. Kinda charming, in a I accidentally left my window open during a rainstorm way.

Why do I feel like the director just woke up one morning, decided to grab a camera, and illegally film in my old neighborhood? Like hey there’s Dave, the guy who owes me ten bucks, pretending he's not trying to be seen. The vibe was so real, so raw, it kinda smelled like old socks, beer, and that thing you can never quite get the funk out of. You know what I mean, right?

>I don't even know what to say about the music. Like, if the electricity went out at a local dive bar and the band just kept playing anyway, every room mumbled with instruments that are just trying to find the right key but holding a 3AM sense of beauty in their failed attempts. Make sense? No? Good, because neither did that one scene with the brick wall and the shoelace—what in the world was that about?

It's one of those films that makes you wanna download the movie just to replay those bits that made your eyebrows twitch involuntarily or audibly say I mean, really?. Trust me, just watch the movie with a half-open mind. Or maybe with both eyes tightly shut.

Here's a bit of code that I jotted down on my phone, conceptually relevant I guess? Who knows:
```python
def riff_raff_tally(timeline):
    headaches = 0
    insights = 0
    for moment in timeline:
        if confusion in moment:
            headaches += 1
        elif truth in moment:
            insights += 1
    return insights - headaches
```

Just a taste of the absurd. Anyway, Riff Raff—it's like meeting a stray cat at 3AM. You're partly afraid, partly in love, and mostly just mesmerized by the unpredictability of it all. And now I need a nap.
